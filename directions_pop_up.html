	<h1>Directions</h1>
	<p>You are about to engage in a "jigsaw" style cooperative learning activity about how a toaster works.</p>
	<p>You will learn about how a toaster holds toast in place and pops up, while your partner learns about how toasters heat up toast.</p>
	<p>Watch the video on the next page, and be ready to teach your partner about what your learn. You and your partner will be quizzed on the content of BOTH videos, and your score will be the average of your own score and your partner's score. It's important to learn about what's in your own video, to learn from your partner about what's in their video, and to teach your partner about what you have learned, as all of these things will affect your score.</p>
